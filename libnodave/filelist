nodave.c	Main library source code file
nodave.h	Library header file
nodavesimple.h	Simplified Library header file. This file is not intended to be used as the 
		header file for your application. It is there to give a hind to people who
		want to use libnodave from applications in VB or dot.net what is the minimum
		they must make known to these languages for simple applications. I use it in
		test applications only to verify that is sufficient indeed.
