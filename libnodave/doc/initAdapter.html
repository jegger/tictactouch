With the resulting daveInterface structure, you need to initialize an adapter, if one is used:
<pre>    
    res =daveInitAdapter(di);
</re>    
While currently only MPI-adapters really need this initialization procedure, it is save to use
daveInitAdapter() with any protocol type. If it has no meaning for the protocol used, it is
mapped to a dummy procedure that returns allways success.

After successfully initializing your adapter, you can retrieve a list of reachable partners
