/*
 Part of Libnodave, a free communication libray for Siemens S7 200/300/400 via
 the MPI adapter 6ES7 972-0CA22-0XAC
 or  MPI adapter 6ES7 972-0CA23-0XAC
 or  TS adapter 6ES7 972-0CA33-0XAC
 or  MPI adapter 6ES7 972-0CA11-0XAC,
 IBH/MHJ-NetLink or CPs 243, 343 and 443
 or VIPA Speed7 with builtin ethernet support.
 
 This file allows read and write access to an USB device which is not supported by any 
 kernel driver from a user program. While I provide a kernel driver for Linux 2.6.13
 this file could be a solution independent of kernel versions.
